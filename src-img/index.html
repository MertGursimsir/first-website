		<p id="paragraph">Fire is both hot and dry. It closely linked to air. Fire needs 3 things in order to exist: oxygen, fuel and heat.</p>
		<p id="paragraph">Fire can be heard, felt, seen and it creates light, heat and smoke.</p>
		<p id="paragraph">Fire might seem dangerous and not safe and also in Japanese traditions, fire represented things that destroy. Although, fire is one of the most essential things in the world. The control of fire by early humans was a turning point in the technological evolution of humans because fire provided a source of warmth, protection from predators, a way to create more advanced hunting tools, and a method for cooking food.</p>
